We will focus on [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49). The app is aimed to provide esimates on chances of winning a lottery so that people make an informed decision. Teh app will also help to de-addict compulsive addicts\n",

    "We managed to write four main functions for our app:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "   - `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "   - `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "   - `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",
    "   \n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "  - Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time"
