The next two are the month (April) using the standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). The last digit indicates if this is a single game (0), first game (1) or second game (2) if more than one game is played during a day, usually a double header The id record starts the description of a game thus ending the description of the preceding game in the file.*\n",

    "\n",
    "The following are opportunities for normalization of our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In `person`, all the debut dates will be able to be reproduced using game log data.\n",
    "  - In `team`, the start, end and sequence columns will be able to be reproduced using game log data.\n",
    "  - In `park`, the start and end years will be able to be reproduced using game log data. While technically the state is an attribute of the city, we might not want to have a an incomplete city/state table so we will leave this in.\n",
    "  - There are lots of places in `game log` where we have a player ID followed by the players name. We will be able to remove this and use the name data in person\n",
    "  - In `game`, all offensive and defensive stats are repeated for the home team and the visiting team. We could break these out and have a table that lists each game twice, one for each team, and cut out this column repetition.\n",
    "  - Similarly, in `game`, we have a listing for 9 players on each team with their positions - we can remove these and have one table that tracks player appearances and their positions.\n",
    "  - We can do a similar thing with the umpires from `game`, instead of listing all four positions as columns, we can put the umpires either in their own table or make one table for players, umpires and managers.\n",
    "  - We have several awards in `game` like winning pitcher and losing pitcher. We can either break these out into their own table, have a table for awards, or combine the awards in with general appearances like the players and umpires.\n",
